______________________________________________

This program uses the ncurses library.
To compile it, you need install this library (the libncurses5-dev package for Debian for instance).
You will also need to install GNU Make, which you probably already have.

Just run :

$ make clean && make

in this very directory.

More instructions will be provided in the help menu of the program, also available in the help.txt file in
the bin folder.
The program will require a config.cfg file and a help.txt file it its running path to function properly;
error message will be displayed accordingly if those are missing.
